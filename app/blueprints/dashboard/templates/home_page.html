        <h2>Why PPE Detection Matters</h2>
        <p>Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) plays a crucial role in ensuring safety in workplaces, especially in high-risk environments such as construction sites, factories, and healthcare facilities. Our PPE Detection System helps organizations ensure that safety standards are met at all times. By detecting PPE usage in real-time through advanced computer vision and AI technology, we can reduce workplace accidents, improve compliance with safety regulations, and ultimately save lives.</p>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>The PPE Detection System uses cutting-edge AI algorithms to detect safety gear such as helmets, gloves, and vests in real-time through CCTV camera feeds. Our system processes video frames, analyzing the presence of required safety gear, and instantly alerts the supervisors if any discrepancies are detected.</p>
